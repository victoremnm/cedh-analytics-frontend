# cEDH Analytics Frontend

A Next.js dashboard for cEDH analytics with a restrained Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty-inspired aesthetic. The focus is on clarity, density, and fast scanning while keeping the UI cinematic and minimal.

## Highlights

- Console-style layout with charts, tables, and KPI cards
- Muted neon palette (cyan + amber) with high-contrast surfaces
- Data-first hierarchy: hero → snapshot → charts → performance table → quick links

## Development

```bash
npm run dev -- --port 4322 --hostname 127.0.0.1
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4322/` to view the home dashboard.
